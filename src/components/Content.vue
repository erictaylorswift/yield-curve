            the 10 and 2 year <b>treasury yield spread</b> 
            is a simple metric which has historically predicted seven of the last seven U.S. economic recessions. 
            <em>that’s 100% of the time for anyone doing the math.</em>

        </h2>
        <p>
            the spread is the difference between the interest rates of ten (DSG10) and two (DSG2) year US treasury notes at any given moment.<br/> 
            if the indicator is above zero ... we good. if the indicator is below zero ... *gulp*. that’s all. like I said, it’s a simple indicator.

            <span>##</span> what is this?
        </h2>
        <p>
            treasury notes are just a fancy way for the government to borrow money from lenders. when the gov borrows money the lenders want a little something back for covering the risk of lending money to them.<br/><br/>
            naturally, you might expect longer term loans to anyone to get back a higher return. after all, the future gets harder to predict the further out it is.<br/><br/>
            a waning spread means lenders are less confident in the future of the US economy. a waning spread and their subsequent inversion(s) have accurately predicted every recession since 1970
